About
The Violation Management System (VMS) is built to streamline the process of recording, managing, and resolving student violations. Whether it’s a minor dress code issue or a more serious offense, this system provides a simple way to ensure every incident is documented and handled appropriately.

Features
Easy Violation Logging: Quickly record and categorize student violations.
Policy Management: Keep all school rules and policies in one place for easy reference.
Automated Interventions: The system suggests or applies interventions based on the type and severity of each violation.
Reports & Tracking: Generate summaries and detailed reports for administrators and teachers.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed with simplicity in mind for both staff and students.
Violations
Any actions or behaviors that don’t align with the school’s rules and policies are considered violations. These can range from simple dress code issues to more serious infractions such as academic dishonesty or property damage.

Policies
All students are expected to follow the rules and guidelines set by the school. Common violations include:

Dress code infractions
Tardiness or absenteeism
Academic cheating
Disrespectful behavior
Deviations from these rules will be logged and managed through the VMS.

Interventions
Once a violation is recorded, the system recommends interventions based on the type and seriousness of the infraction. Interventions may include:

Counseling sessions
Parental notifications
Detentions or suspensions
Educational workshops
The goal is to correct behavior and help students learn from their mistakes.
